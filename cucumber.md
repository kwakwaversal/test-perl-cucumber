# Cucumber
Behaviour-drive development ([BDD]) described using the [Gherkin] language.

# DESCRIPTION
This document tries to explain what Cucumber is in the context of [Perl] and
the [Test::BDD::Cucumber] distribution available on [CPAN].

# What is Cucmber
* User stories, but better.
They're like user stories, but better as the language (Gherkin) is used to
describe a feature/business use case and can also be used by a developer to
implement the code and tests.

# What I like
* Tags - not unique to Cucumber, but... Add @wip and then run `-t wip` to only execute what you're working on.
